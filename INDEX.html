Title: The Casino on outpost 11
Scene: In a cold dreery moon crater at the edge of the glaxy is mining outpost 11. To liken it to anything
 other than a wild west shanty town would do it a disservice, but for me it is home. I am a service droid,
I run the craps table 24/7. The flow of dirty miners is only slowed down by their need for food and sleep.
Many of the miners spend so much time with me they don't get enough of either. The casino boss ordered me as
 a custom order, I am the closest thing to a female human in this sector, at least from the waist up.
  The rest of me is built into the table. I try to encourage the miners to save their money or at least spend 
  it at the bar where they might get something in return, but shift after shift they show up with chips in hand
 hoping to score a jackpot and pay for a ride of this rock.... -->
